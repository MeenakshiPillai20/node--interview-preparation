        <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
       
        <h2> 1. What is node.js? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> Node is free, open-source and also runs in various environment. It is a Javascript runtime Environment built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine that is used for running web applications outside the Web browser. Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. 
        </p>

        <p> Node.js is often used for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. Also used to build server-side, input-output, event-driven apps. It is used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart and so on. </p>
        
        <h2> 2. What is NPM? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> NPM stands for the Node Package Manager. NPM is a package manager for for the JavaScript runtime environment i.e Node.js. The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js. It is used for node dependency management. Most of the time, we use npm as a server-side node dependency tool.</p>

        <p>NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code. Nested dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on another dependency. Node.js. helps to manage a project’s dependencies. NPM generates a package-lock.json file. The package-lock will generate the same node_modules folder for different npm versions.</p>

        <h2> 3. What are the modules in Node.js? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> Node modules provide a way to re-use code in your Node application. It is a piece of re-usable code with a defined interface and it has the ability to break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks. You bring a module into scope using require() function.  </p>

        <p>Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality. Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders. Modules are of three types i.e Core Modules, local Modules, Third-party Modules</p>

        

       <p><span>Core Modules:</span> Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation. These modules can be loaded into the program by using the require function. Some Examples are: </p>

      <div class="box">
        <p><b class="title">http :</b> creates an HTTP server in Node.js.</p>
        <p><b class="title">assert :</b> set of assertion functions useful for testing.</p>
        <p><b class="title">fs :</b> used to handle file system.</p>
        <p><b class="title">path :</b> includes methods to deal with file paths.</p>
        <p><b class="title">process :</b> provides information and control about the current Node.js process.</p>
        <p><b class="title">os :</b> provides information about the operating system.</p>
        <p><b class="title">querystring :</b> utility used for parsing and formatting URL query strings.</p> 
        <p><b class="title">url :</b> pmodule provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.</p>
      </div>

    

      <p><span>Local Modules:</span> Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js application. Since this file provides attributes to the outer world via exports, another file can use its exported functionality using the require() function. Some Examples are: add, sub, mult, div, etc. </p>

   

      <p><span>Third-party modules:</span> Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM). These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally. Some Examples are: mongoose, express, angular, and react. </p>



        <h2> 4. What is the purpose of the module.exports? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, arrays, strings, etc. from one file and can use them in other files by importing them by require() method. By using this it is easy to maintain and manage the code base in different modules. By not using module.exports it becomes difficult to write a large program without modular/reusable code.
        </p>

        <p>The main purpose of module.exports is to achieve modular programming. Modular programming refers to separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.</p>

        <p>Using module.exports we can separate logics from other modules. In other terms, we can achieve abstraction using it.</p>

        <h2> 5. Difference between default export and named export? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> Named exports are useful to export multiple objects, functions or variables, whereas default exports are useful to export only a single object, function or variable from a
          single file.</p>

        <p>During the import, in Named Export it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object, whereas in Default Export we can use any name to import.</p>

        <p>Named exports are imported with curly braces, whereas Default Export don't need any curly braces while importing.</p>

        <p>Named Export don't use default tag, whereas Default Export uses default tag.</p>

        <h2> 6. How do you import any module in Node.js? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code. To import we can use require method in this the result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation. Exampleb --- const f = require('./func') ---
        </p>

        <p>We can also import files using import function which will import modules from the file which is provided. Example ----import defaultExport from "module-name"; ------</p>

        <h2> 7. What are the different types of HTTP requests? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to
          specify what action is to be performed on a particular resource. The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These are equivalent to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).
        </p>

        <div class="box">
          <p><b class="title">GET :</b> GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. It returns status code of 200 if data is successfully retrieved from the server.</p>
          
          <p><b class="title">POST :</b> POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server.It returns status code of 201 if successfully created.</p>
          
          <p><b class="title">PUT :</b>  A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.</p>
         
          <p><b class="title">PATCH :</b> PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the content that you want to update.</p>
         
          <p><b class="title">DELETE :</b> A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.</p>
        </div>

        <h2> 8. Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js., Create a middleware which will be applicable to all the routes? </h2>
       
        <p> 
          <span> Ans.</span> Middleware is required for helping developers in building applications more effectively and efficiently. The middleware will act as a connection between data, applications, and the users. These middleware in node.js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.
        </p>

        <p>Middleware are like any general functions which takes three parameters request, response and next function. These middleware are used to execute some function before the response is send to the client. It mostly gets used for authentication, that before we send the response, we can authenticate if the API request is called from the client with proper user credentials or not. These middleware can be applied on the whole application level as well as on one particular API route.</p>

        <p>Next function is a very important, after the end of each middleware we should execute next function so that the program execution can move either to next middleware or the main route,if this function is not added then execution will not move forward.</p>
  

        <h2> 9. Explain CORS, Implement CORS?</h2>
       
        <p> <span> Ans.</span> CORS : (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism by which data or any other resource of a site could be shared intentionally to a third party website when there is a need. Generally, access to resources that are residing in a third party site is restricted by the browser clients for security purposes. </p>

        <p>CORS is typically required to build web applications that access APIs hosted on a different domain or origin. You can enable CORS to allow requests to your API from a web application hosted on a different domain.</p>

        <h2> 10. What is Express. How it helps you to create a backend application?</h2>
       
        <p> <span> Ans.</span> Creating API by just pure node.js will become difficult if your application will grow. This is the reason why we use this framework Express. Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuing Node.js features.</p>

        <p>Express is a Node.js framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications. It requires less coding time, and makes it much easier and simpler to build a web server with the use of routing and middleware, which can handle requests and responses. Many popular companies are using Express in their application because it has more features than Node.js.</p>

        <p> It is used to build web-apps using approaches and principles of Node.js. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects. It facilitates the rendering ofdynamic HTTP objects. </p>

        <h2> 11. Explain min 5 status codes gets used in Backend development?</h2>
       
        <p> <span> Ans.</span> An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to
          indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled</p>

          <div class="box">
            <p><b class="title">200 :</b> OK </p>
            <p><b class="title">101 :</b> Processing</p> 
            <p><b class="title">400 :</b> Bad Request </p>
            <p><b class="title">404 :</b> Page Not Found</p>
            <p><b class="title">500 :</b> Internal Server Error</p>
            <p><b class="title">402 :</b> Payment Required</p>
            <p><b class="title">401 :</b> Unauthorized</p>
            <p><b class="title">503 :</b> Service Unavailable</p>
            <p><b class="title">403 :</b> Forbidden</p>
          </div>

        <h2> 12. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?</h2>
       
        <p> <span> Ans.</span>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol whereas HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</p>

        <p>HTTP is the most widely used protocol for data transfer over the Web but the data (i.e. hypertext) exchanged using http is not as secure as we would like it to be as it transfer data as plain text, whereas HTTPS is HTTP with encryption i.e. HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses.  </p>

        <h2> 13. What are JWT tokens?</h2>
       
        <p> <span> Ans.</span> JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. It can be used for an authentication system and can also be used for information exchange.</p>

        <p>Example :- when we logged-in somewhere , they provide us a unique token.which helps us to access through it token is provided only when the registered data and login data are matching. Ex:-facebook</p>
